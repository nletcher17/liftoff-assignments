### Overview
Pending Drink App Name is an easy-to-use database for cataloging and rating drinks. The App will allow users to log in, create new entries for drinks, and provide a 1-5 rating of the drink. Users will be able to search the database for specific drinks, or filter by style. Users will find the app useful in deciding what they want to drink or reminding themselves of a drink they like.
